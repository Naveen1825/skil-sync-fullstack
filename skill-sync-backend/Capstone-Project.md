SkillSync
In today’s fast-moving job and education ecosystem, companies often find it challenging to identify suitable interns who align well with their project requirements.
Likewise, students face difficulties discovering internship opportunities that truly match their skills, experience, and career interests.

SkillSync bridges this gap by acting as a centralized, intelligent internship management platform where:
Students can register, build profiles, and upload resumes highlighting their skills and interests.
Companies can post available internships, defining the required skill sets and project objectives.
The system employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backed by an LLM, which analyzes both the student resumes and the internship descriptions.
It then recommends best-fit matches for both sides — suggesting ideal interns to companies and suitable opportunities to students.
This intelligent matching reduces manual screening time, ensures higher placement accuracy, and enhances the internship experience for both participants.
Additionally, an Admin Dashboard provides insights into system activity, such as match success rates, skill demand trends, and internship engagement statistics.
