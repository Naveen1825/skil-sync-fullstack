Domain 1: Healthcare 
 
D1-PS1: AI-Powered Medical Imaging 
Background: Diagnosing diseases from medical scans such as X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans is a critical 
yet time-consuming process that heavily depends on human expertise. Radiologists and doctors often 
face fatigue, increasing the chances of oversight or misinterpretation — especially when dealing with 
large  volumes  of  data.  In  resource-limited  hospitals,  delayed  or  inaccurate  interpretations  can 
significantly affect patient outcomes. 
Problem Statement: Develop an intelligent software tool that can automatically analyse uploaded 
medical images and highlight regions that appear abnormal or suspicious. The goal is to assist medical 
professionals in early detection and decision-making, not replace them. 
 
D1-PS2: Remote Patient Monitoring Dashboard 
Background: Chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart conditions require continuous 
health tracking to prevent emergencies. Yet most healthcare facilities still depend on manual updates or 
disconnected systems, leaving doctors with fragmented patient data. A centralized monitoring solution 
— accessible from multiple devices — can help detect early warning signs, streamline response, and 
improve patient outcomes. 
Problem Statement: Build a system that simulates real-time monitoring of patient vitals such as heart 
rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation using mock or sample datasets. The platform should allow 
healthcare providers to visualize multiple patients’ vitals simultaneously, receive alerts when values 
cross safe thresholds, and view historical health data trends. 
 
D1-PS3: AI Chatbot for Mental Health 
Background: Stress, anxiety, and depression are rising rapidly across all age groups, yet timely access 
to mental health professionals remains limited. Many individuals hesitate to seek help due to stigma, 
distance,  or  cost,  resulting  in  late  intervention  and  worsening  conditions.  Technology  offers  an 
opportunity to provide early, accessible, and judgment-free support through intelligent tools that can 
listen, assess, and guide users toward better mental wellbeing. 
Problem Statement: Create an AI-based system that can understand user input—through text, speech, 
or  other  interactions—detect  signs  of  stress  or  emotional  distress,  and  offer  meaningful  coping 
strategies.  The  solution  should  be  capable  of  assessing  emotional  state,  providing  personalized 
suggestions, and connecting users to professional or emergency resources in severe cases. 
 
D1-PS4: Hospital Queue & Appointment Optimizer 
Background: Long waiting times in hospitals and clinics not only frustrate patients but also reduce the 
efficiency of medical staff and resources. In many healthcare centres, appointments and walk-ins 
overlap  without  proper  coordination,  leading  to  congestion,  delayed  consultations,  and  patient 
dissatisfaction.  A  smarter  scheduling  system  can  help  streamline  patient  flow,  balance  doctor 
availability, and enhance overall hospital operations. 
 
Problem Statement: Develop an intelligent system that predicts patient waiting times and optimizes 
scheduling to reduce delays and resource bottlenecks. The solution should manage appointments, 
estimate queue lengths, and dynamically adjust based on real-time updates such as doctor availability 
or emergency cases. 

 
D1-PS5: Disease Progression Predictor 
Background: In critical care and chronic disease management, timely intervention can make the 
difference between recovery and severe complications. However, doctors often rely on periodic check-
ups and manual review of patient data, which may delay the detection of early warning signs. Predictive 
analysis of patient vitals and health records can help anticipate deterioration before it becomes critical, 
enabling faster, life-saving decisions. 
 
Problem Statement: Develop an AI-based system that predicts the likelihood of a patient’s condition 
worsening, classifying risk levels as low, medium, or high. The system should analyse historical and 
current health parameters to identify patterns that indicate potential decline, supporting doctors with 
data-backed insights for early intervention. 
 
Domain 2: FinTech 
 
D2-PS1: Fraud Detection in UPI/Online Payments 
Background: As digital transactions through wallets, UPI, and online banking continue to surge, so do 
instances of fraudulent activity. Unusual spending behaviour, rapid transfers, or irregular location-based 
transactions often go unnoticed until it’s too late. Detecting such anomalies early is essential for 
protecting both users and financial institutions from significant losses. 
Problem Statement: Design a system that analyses transaction data—such as amount, frequency, 
location, and timing—to identify suspicious or potentially fraudulent patterns. The solution should be 
capable of flagging anomalies that deviate from a user’s typical behaviour and providing interpretable 
insights into why a transaction is marked as risky. 
 
D2-PS2: AI-Based Stock Market Sentiment Tracker 
Background: In financial markets, investor sentiment plays a major role in driving stock prices. Traders 
and analysts increasingly depend on real-time data from news articles, social media, and forums to 
gauge public opinion about companies or sectors. However, manually tracking this information is time-
consuming and prone to bias. Automating the process with sentiment analysis can give investors timely 
insights and a clearer view of market mood. 
Problem Statement: Build a system that collects and analyses financial news headlines, articles, or 
social media posts related to specific companies or sectors, classifying them as positive, negative, or 
neutral. The  goal  is  to  help  users  visualize  overall  sentiment  trends  and  understand  how  public 
perception might influence stock performance. 
 
D2PS3: Loan Default Predictor 
Background: Financial institutions face significant challenges in assessing the repayment ability of 
borrowers. Traditional credit scoring systems often fail to capture subtle behavioural or contextual 
indicators,  leading  to  inaccurate  evaluations  and  loan  defaults.  With  the  growing  availability  of 
applicant and transaction data, machine learning offers a smarter, data-driven approach to predict 
repayment likelihood and reduce financial risk. 
Problem Statement: Develop a machine learning model that predicts the probability of a borrower 
defaulting on a loan based on applicant data such as income, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and 
other relevant features. The system should generate a clear risk classification (e.g., low, medium, high) 
and provide basic reasoning or feature importance for each prediction to ensure interpretability. 
 
D2-PS4: Smart Invoice Digitizer 
Background:  Small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) often  depend on manual methods for 
managing invoices, receipts, and billing documents. This approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and 
inefficient—especially when dealing with large volumes of paperwork. Automating invoice extraction 
and  classification  can  help  businesses  streamline  accounting,  improve  record  accuracy,  and  save 
valuable time. 

 
Problem Statement: Develop a system that can read invoices in PDF or image format, extract key 
details  such  as  invoice  number,  date,  vendor,  amount,  and  tax  values  using  Optical  Character 
Recognition (OCR), and automatically categorize them into structured formats for storage or analysis. 
 
D2-PS5: Credit Risk Scoring Platform 
Background: Banks, NBFCs, and digital lenders require quick yet reliable ways to evaluate loan 
applicants. Traditional credit scoring systems often depend on incomplete data or lack transparency in 
how scores are derived, leading to unfair decisions or missed opportunities. An AI-driven scoring 
platform can make the process faster, fairer, and more explainable by analysing a broader set of 
borrower attributes. 
 
Problem Statement: Design a system that generates creditworthiness scores based on simplified 
borrower  profiles,  using  parameters  such  as  income,  repayment  history,  liabilities,  and  spending 
behaviour. The solution should emphasize clarity and fairness by showing how each factor influences 
the final score. 
 
Domain 3: Artificial Intelligence 
 
D3-PS1: Fake News Detector 
Background: In today’s hyperconnected world, misinformation spreads faster than verified facts, often 
influencing public opinion, elections, and even social stability. The rise of social media and unverified 
online sources has made it increasingly difficult for users to distinguish authentic news from fabricated 
content.  Combating  this  challenge requires  automated,  data-driven  systems  that  can  evaluate  the 
credibility of information in real time. 
Problem Statement: Develop an AI-based system that analyses news articles, headlines, or social 
media posts and classifies them as real or fake based on linguistic, contextual, and source-based cues. 
The system should provide a confidence level or reliability score for each classification, helping users 
assess the trustworthiness of the content they consume. 
 
D3-PS2: Human Pose Detection 
Background: Human pose estimation has wide-ranging applications in fitness tracking, sports analysis, 
rehabilitation, animation, and augmented reality. By detecting and mapping key body points from 
images  or  video  frames, pose  detection  systems  can  analyse  movement,  form,  and  posture  with 
precision. Building such systems bridges the gap between computer vision and real-world motion 
understanding. 
Problem Statement: Develop a software tool that can accurately detect and visualize key body joints 
from uploaded images or short video clips. The system should identify major body landmarks—such as 
limbs, joints, and torso positions—and generate a clear skeletal overlay that represents human posture 
or movement. 
 
D3-PS3: Text-to-Image Generator 
Background: Generative AI has unlocked new ways to create art, design mock-ups, and visualize ideas 
from simple textual prompts. Open-source diffusion and transformer models make it possible for 
creators,  designers,  and  students  to  prototype  visuals  quickly  without  deep  graphics  expertise. 
Democratizing this capability helps speed up ideation, lowers the barrier to creative exploration, and 
supports rapid prototyping across domains. 
Problem Statement: Build a simplified text-to-image system that converts user prompts into visually 
coherent images  using open-source  models  and libraries. The solution should focus on usability, 
responsible content filters, and producing outputs that are relevant to the given prompts. 
 
D3-PS4: Research Assistant AI Agent 
Background: Students and researchers spend hours hunting for relevant papers, filtering noise, and 
extracting the useful bits. The process is repetitive and inefficient: locating high-quality sources, 
understanding their contributions, and prioritizing which papers to read takes time away from actual 
research and learning. 
 
7 
 
Problem Statement: Create an AI agent that, given a research topic or query, autonomously finds 
relevant  academic  papers,  summarizes  their  key  contributions  and  methods,  and  ranks  them  by 
relevance and quality. The agent should help users quickly grasp which works matter most for a given 
question and why, reducing the time from topic to insight. 
 
D3-PS5: Sentiment Analysis for Social Media 
Background: Online conversations shape brand perception in real time. Tweets, reviews, and posts are 
a goldmine of customer insight, but volume and noise make manual monitoring impractical. Brands 
that can quickly read the room gain an edge — spotting PR risks, measuring campaign impact, and 
discovering unmet user needs sooner. 
 
Problem Statement: Build an NLP-based system that analyses social media content (e.g., tweets, posts, 
comments) for sentiment and emotional tone, and surface actionable insights for a given hashtag, 
keyword, or brand. The system should handle noisy short-text data, account for context (sarcasm, 
emojis, slang where possible), and produce aggregated signals that help stakeholders understand public 
mood and trends. 
  
 
Domain 4: Education & Learning Technologies 
 
D4-PS1: AI Virtual Tutor            
Background: Many students need one-on-one explanations and practice but classrooms and instructors 
have limited bandwidth. Personalized tutoring—adapting to a student’s pace, gaps, and learning style—
boosts understanding and retention, yet is often expensive or inaccessible. Intelligent tutoring systems 
can fill that gap by delivering targeted guidance, practice problems, and explanations when students 
need them. 
Problem Statement: Build an AI-driven tutoring system that interactively explains concepts, adapts to 
a student’s pace, and provides practice tailored to their strengths and weaknesses. The solution should 
support multi-turn interaction, clarify misunderstandings, and present explanations at an appropriate 
level for the learner. 
 
D4-PS2: Student Performance Predictor 
Background: Teachers often realize too late when students begin to fall behind. Early signs like 
irregular attendance, missed assignments, or declining test scores are easy to miss without consistent 
tracking. Technology can help educators identify these patterns early and support students before poor 
performance becomes failure. 
Problem Statement: Create a system that analyses student-related data to identify those at risk of 
underperforming. The solution should highlight learning trends and provide clear insights to help 
teachers or mentors take timely action and offer personalized support. 
 
D4-PS3: Plagiarism & AI-Generated Content Detector 
Background: With AI tools becoming widely accessible, students can now generate essays, reports, 
and assignments in seconds. While such tools can support learning, they also blur the line between 
original effort and automated output. Educators face growing difficulty in distinguishing genuine 
student work from copied or AI-generated text, calling for smarter detection systems. 
 
Problem Statement: Design a system that analyses student submissions to identify possible plagiarism 
and detect AI-generated writing. The tool should assess text originality, highlight suspicious sections, 
and provide clear, interpretable indicators of content authenticity. 
 
D4-PS4: Coding Practice Assistant 
Background: Students learning to code often get stuck on small errors or inefficient patterns and need 
immediate, contextual guidance. Waiting for instructor feedback or searching forums interrupts flow 
and slows learning. Real-time, helpful hints — not just final answers — accelerate mastery and teach 
debugging as a skill. 
Problem Statement: Create an intelligent tool that analyses student code and offers actionable, step-
wise suggestions: bug explanation, probable fixes, style or complexity improvements, and hints that 
nudge learners toward the solution without giving it away. The system should be pedagogically aware 
9 
 
(prioritize learning over giving answers) and produce clear, interpretable feedback that students and 
instructors can trust. 
 
D4-PS5: AI Auto-Grader for Code Submissions 
Background: Instructors face a heavy burden grading large volumes of programming assignments. 
Manual grading is slow, inconsistent, and often focuses on output correctness while missing style, 
efficiency, and pedagogical feedback. Students benefit more from fast, constructive feedback that helps 
them learn from mistakes immediately. 
 
Problem  Statement:  Design  an  AI-driven  auto-grading  system  that  evaluates  programming 
assignments by running tests, checking correctness, and providing actionable, pedagogical feedback. 
The system should help instructors scale assessment while giving students meaningful, timely guidance 
to improve their code and understanding.

-VTRICKS TECHNOLOGIES 
 
D5-PS4: Intelligent Resume Filtering 
Background: Hiring teams sift through large volumes of resumes to find suitable candidates, wasting 
time on manual screening and risking biased or inconsistent shortlisting. Recruiters need tools that can 
quickly surface relevant applicants while preserving fairness, transparency, and auditability in the hiring 
pipeline. 
 
Problem Statement: Build  an  intelligent  resume  filtering  system  that  helps  recruiters  prioritize 
applicants by extracting structured information (skills, experience, education), matching profiles to job 
requirements, and surfacing the best-fit candidates with interpretable reasons. The solution should 
support scalable pre-screening while reducing unconscious bias and improving hiring efficiency. 
 
D5-PS5: AI-Based Job Description Matching
