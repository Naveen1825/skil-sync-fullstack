Question:
Can you attach files in SMTP? 

Answer:
Yes — you can attach files in SMTP, but SMTP itself does not handle attachments directly. Instead, attachments are included using MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), which encodes the file (usually Base64) and wraps it inside the email body.

✅ How attachments work in SMTP

SMTP only transfers text, so binary files (PDF, images, etc.) are encoded using Base64 and formatted like this:
	•	The email is set to MIME type multipart/mixed
	•	A boundary string separates different parts
	•	One part contains the text body
	•	Another part contains the Base64-encoded attachment

✅ Example (Python smtplib)

Here’s a simple example of sending an email with an attachment in Python:

import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email import encoders

sender = "you@example.com"
receiver = "someone@example.com"
password = "your_smtp_password"

msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg["From"] = sender
msg["To"] = receiver
msg["Subject"] = "Test Email with Attachment"

# Text part
msg.attach(MIMEText("This is an email with an attachment.", "plain"))

# Attachment part
filename = "file.pdf"
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    part = MIMEBase("application", "octet-stream")
    part.set_payload(f.read())

encoders.encode_base64(part)
part.add_header("Content-Disposition", f"attachment; filename= {filename}")

msg.attach(part)

# Send email
server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587)
server.starttls()
server.login(sender, password)
server.sendmail(sender, receiver, msg.as_string())
server.quit()

✅ Summary

Feature	SMTP Support
Sending plain text email	✅ Yes
Sending HTML email	✅ Yes (via MIME)
Sending attachments	✅ Yes (via MIME base64 encoding)
Sending multiple attachments	✅ Yes


Question:Can you attach CSV and Excel files (XLS/XLSX) using SMTP?

Answer:
Yes — you can attach CSV and Excel files (XLS/XLSX) using the exact same SMTP + MIME method. ✅

✅ CSV Attachment

CSV is just text, so it is attached as:

text/csv

(or simply as application/octet-stream)

✅ Excel Attachment

Excel files (XLSX or XLS) are binary formats:
	•	XLS → application/vnd.ms-excel
	•	XLSX → application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet

But even if you don’t specify the exact MIME type, SMTP will still send it correctly as long as you Base64 encode and include Content-Disposition: attachment.

✅ Python Example (CSV + XLSX)

attachments = ["data.csv", "report.xlsx"]

for file in attachments:
    with open(file, "rb") as f:
        part = MIMEBase("application", "octet-stream")
        part.set_payload(f.read())

    encoders.encode_base64(part)
    part.add_header("Content-Disposition", f"attachment; filename={file}")

    msg.attach(part)

✅ Summary

File Type	Can attach via SMTP?	MIME Type
.csv	✅ Yes	text/csv
.xls	✅ Yes	application/vnd.ms-excel
.xlsx	✅ Yes	application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet

✅ Works on Gmail SMTP, Outlook SMTP, AWS SES SMTP, SendGrid SMTP, etc.
