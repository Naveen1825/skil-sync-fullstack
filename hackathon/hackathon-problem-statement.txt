Intelligent Resume Filtering
Background: Hiring teams sift through large volumes of resumes to find suitable candidates, wasting
time on manual screening and risking biased or inconsistent shortlisting. Recruiters need tools that can
quickly surface relevant applicants while preserving fairness, transparency, and auditability in the hiring
pipeline.
Problem Statement: Build an intelligent resume filtering system that helps recruiters prioritize
applicants by extracting structured information (skills, experience, education), matching profiles to job
requirements, and surfacing the best-fit candidates with interpretable reasons. The solution should
support scalable pre-screening while reducing unconscious bias and improving hiring efficiency.
